// TODO: Add notification when scrolling and a new message is sent
// TODO: Add profile picture on the left side of the username on a sent message
// TODO: Add "(username) is typing..." when someone is writing a message

// FIXME: When text is too long on the width, cut it off and start on a new line
// FIXME: Have one world server, then a few official servers. (Or maybe just a new official servers that act like the world server. Kinda like different boards on a chat platform.)
// FIXME: Choose and have one central language, because now it's a little swedish here and a little english there. One central language. (Maybe add translations and different language options later)
